# balanced_teams
Create two teams that are as balanced as possible.

## Installation

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running


### Setup

The app requires an API Key and a rankings file.
To provide these, you will need to create a [.env file](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) with:
```sh
cp .env.template .env
```

`BALANCE_THE_FORCE_API_KEY` is the discord bot api key.

`BALANCE_THE_FORCE_RANKINGS_DIRECTORY` is the directory where the rankings file `rankings.json` will be found.
If left blank, the app directory will be used. If provided, it must be an absolute path.

The `.env` file will need to exist, but the values can be overridden using command line arguments:
```sh
python balance_the_force.py --botkey ABC123 --rankings /path/to/dir --verbose
```

### As a Service

If you are on a \*nix system which uses [systemd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd), you can run the bot as a service unit.
You can create the service file with:

```
# From this repository
sudo service.py
```

This will place the service file at `/etc/systemd/system/balance_the_force@.service`.

**Warning**: This file assumes you have Python installed via `pyenv` for *your* user.
If that is not correct, edit the service file with the correct Python executable.


You will then be able to start the service with:
```sh
sudo systemctl start balance_the_force@[Your User Name]
# See if its working
sudo systemctl status balance_the_force@[Your User Name]
# If you want it to start on system boot
sudo systemctl enable balance_the_force@[Your User Name]
```

Windows and MacOS have their own service management which still needs to be implemented.

## Testing

```sh
python test.py
```

* TODO: Make use of discord.ext.commmands: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ext/commands/commands.html
* TODO: Add "bros" mode so that Balazs and Greg can play on the same team while making the teams as fair as possible
* TODO: Move rankings to a Google Sheet and allow users to dynamically upload or apply their own rankings
* TODO: When asking the bot to create teams, tell it who to include or who to exclude
